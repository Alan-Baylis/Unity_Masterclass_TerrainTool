# Unity_Masterclass_TerrainTool
Terrain Sculpting tool made with unity - For MPC Maserclass, 3rd year.

This project was completed over 4 fulltime weeks of development and was for the MPC masterclass option unit in the 3rd year of my degree at the National Centre for Computer Animation. This upload should include both the Unity Project, including the source code in C# and an executable build.
